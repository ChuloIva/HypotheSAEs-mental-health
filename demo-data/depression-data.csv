      Lately, I’ve been feeling like I’m moving through life in slow motion, as if the colors and vibrancy of the world have faded into muted shades of gray;
      it’s not that I’m completely unhappy, but everything feels just a little bit harder than it should, and even the things I used to enjoy, like spending
      time with friends or diving into my hobbies, feel more like chores I have to convince myself to do rather than activities I genuinely look forward to;
      I catch myself wondering why I can’t just snap out of it, as if there’s some invisible barrier between me and the sense of fulfillment I used to have,
      and it’s frustrating because I know deep down that I have so much to be grateful for, yet I can’t seem to shake this subtle but persistent
      heaviness that clouds my thoughts; I still manage to get through the day, ticking off tasks and responsibilities, but there’s this underlying
      sense that I’m not fully present, like I’m just going through the motions rather than actually living, and it’s hard to put into words exactly
      why I feel this way or what’s causing it, which only makes it more confusing and exhausting to deal with.

"It’s like I’m trapped in a storm, and no matter what I do, it keeps getting worse.",1
I feel like my heart is weighed down by sadness that won’t go away.,1
I’ve been so disconnected from myself that I barely recognize who I am anymore.,1
I feel like every effort I make to fix my life just ends in failure.,1
I can’t escape the feeling that I’m broken in ways that can’t ever be repaired.,1
"I feel like my life is slipping through my fingers, and there’s nothing I can do to stop it.",1
"Every moment feels like an eternity, filled with nothing but pain and hopelessness.",1
"I feel like I’m trapped in an endless void, where every single day is a struggle to breathe, to move, to even exist, and no matter how hard I try to claw my
      way out, it feels like the darkness keeps pulling me deeper, suffocating me with thoughts of worthlessness and failure;
      it’s as if I’m drowning in a sea of my own despair, with waves crashing over me, stealing away any glimmer of hope I might have had left,
      and even when I try to reach out for help, the words feel stuck in my throat because I’m terrified that no one will understand or worse,
      that they’ll see just how broken I really am; I can’t shake the overwhelming belief that I’m a burden to everyone around me, that my existence
     only causes pain and disappointment, and it’s so exhausting to carry this weight, to pretend like I’m okay when inside I’m falling apart;
     every attempt I make to find joy or purpose feels hollow, like I’m just going through the motions of life without actually living, and it’s hard to
     imagine a future where this relentless sadness and emptiness don’t consume me entirely, leaving nothing behind but the fragments of who I used to be.
